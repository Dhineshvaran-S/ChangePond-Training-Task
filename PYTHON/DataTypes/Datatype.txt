        it represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data 
        what operations can be performed on a particular data

        Numeric Integer ,float and complex 
        sequence type : string,listand tuple 
        Boolean
        set

    2.Imutable objects cannot change their state or content
    Ex:Numeric,Float,Boolean,string,Tuple

    List:
    mutable object 
    is a sequence data type which is used to store collection of data 
    ordered 

    #tuple 
    -> immutable object
